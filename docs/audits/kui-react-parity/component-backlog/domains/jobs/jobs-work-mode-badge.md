## Overview

Icon + label badge for work location mode (remote, hybrid, on-site).

**Why it matters for KuiNative:** Industry-vertical demo component. KuiReact's own ADR 0003 records this vertical as React-only for KuiEJS; treat it the same way for KuiNative unless a product need appears. Thin semantic wrapper over Badge — trivial once Badge reaches parity.

## Required Props

Parsed from `modules/domains/jobs/job/JobWorkModeBadge.tsx`. **Required** = not optional in KuiReact's type. The KuiNative API must keep these names and defaults unless the RN column says otherwise.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Notes | RN mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workMode` | `JobWorkMode` | **yes** | — |  | same |
| `size` | `'sm' \| 'md' \| 'lg'` | no | `'md'` |  | same |
| `className` | `string` | no | — |  | keep (NativeWind) |

## Variants

### All modes

```tsx
{(['REMOTE', 'HYBRID', 'ONSITE'] as const).map((m) => (
  <JobWorkModeBadge key={m} workMode={m} />
))}
```

Every variant above must have an equivalent demo in `modules/showcase/registry.tsx` with the same title.

**Enumerated props:**

- `size`: 'sm' · 'md' · 'lg' (default 'md')

## States

_No interactive states detected from props; verify in source._

Plus, for every component: light + dark scheme, font scaling (`allowFontScaling` respected, layout survives 200 % text), and RTL (`I18nManager.isRTL`).

## Accessibility Requirements

KuiReact uses the following; each needs its React Native equivalent:

| KuiReact | React Native |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-hidden` | `accessibilityElementsHidden` + `importantForAccessibility="no-hide-descendants"` |

Platform requirements (all components):

- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 pt (iOS) / 48×48 dp (Android) — use `hitSlop` when the visual is smaller.
- Every interactive element has `accessibilityRole` and an accessible name; decorative icons are hidden from the accessibility tree.
- Do not nest multiple interactive elements inside one accessible `Pressable` (iOS merges them into a single element).

## Design Tokens

_No semantic color tokens detected._

Use NativeWind classes (`bg-primary`, …); only props that cannot take `className` (icon `color`, `placeholderTextColor`, `trackColor`, SVG `fill`) may read `useThemeTokens()`. No raw hex.

## Dependencies

**KuiReact components it composes:**

- Badge — exists as `Badge`

**Blocked by (roadmap):** the primitives above reaching parity

**Third-party:** `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` → @fortawesome/react-native-fontawesome, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`

## Implementation Notes

- Location: `modules/domains/jobs/JobWorkModeBadge.tsx`, named export `JobWorkModeBadge` (same name as KuiReact), re-exported from the layer barrel.
- Styling via `cn()` + semantic token classes; variant/size maps as `Record<Variant, string>` like the existing KuiNative components.
- Props: keep KuiReact names/defaults; spread remaining host props (`...rest`) and forward `ref` so `testID`, `accessibilityHint`, `hitSlop` etc. pass through (current KuiNative components mostly do not).
- Export the `JobWorkModeBadgeProps` type.
- Add a showcase entry (`modules/showcase/registry.tsx`) with one demo per KuiReact variant.
- Domain component: create `modules/domains/jobs/` with a barrel; do not import across verticals (KuiReact enforces this with `check:cross-vertical`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exported as `JobWorkModeBadge` from the `modules/domains/jobs` barrel with its props type
- [ ] All 3 KuiReact props present with identical names and defaults, or each deviation recorded in `parity.exceptions.json` (RN mappings above are pre-approved deviations)
- [ ] Showcase demos for all 1 KuiReact variants (All modes)
- [ ] Accessibility mappings in the table above implemented and verified with VoiceOver and TalkBack
- [ ] Uses only semantic tokens; renders correctly in light and dark
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest + @testing-library/react-native) cover render, every variant/size, every state, callbacks and accessibility props
- [ ] Prop table + usage snippet documented in the showcase entry
