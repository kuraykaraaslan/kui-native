## Overview

Coupon code input with apply/remove flow. Calls onApply which returns success/error; shows applied state once a valid code is accepted.

**Why it matters for KuiNative:** Common vertical is shipped in KuiReact's npm package (`./common` entry) and is shared with KuiEJS; it is the only domain vertical with a parity obligation.

## KuiReact Reference

| --- | --- |
| Source | `kui-react/modules/domains/common/discount/CouponInput.tsx` (1 file, 105 LOC) |
| Public export | `@kuraykaraaslan/kui-react/common` — public (npm: root + /common) |
| Registry | yes · status `stable` · since 2025-04 |
| Showcase variants | Default (try SAVE20), Applied state |
| Composes | Button (exists as `Button`), Input (exists as `TextInput`) |
| Used by (registry) | — |
| Usage frequency | imported by 3 production file(s), 1 showcase file(s) |
| Third-party imports | `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` |
| Unit tests | none |
| Interaction flags | keyboard handling, hover styles |

## Required Props

Parsed from `modules/domains/common/discount/CouponInput.tsx`. **Required** = not optional in KuiReact's type. The KuiNative API must keep these names and defaults unless the RN column says otherwise.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Notes | RN mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onApply` | `(code: string) => Promise<{ success: boolean; message?: string }> \| { success: …` | **yes** | — |  | same |
| `onRemove` | `() => void` | no | — |  | same |
| `appliedCode` | `string` | no | — |  | same |
| `className` | `string` | no | — |  | keep (NativeWind) |

## Variants

### Default (try SAVE20)

```tsx
<CouponInput onApply={async (code) => validateCoupon(code)} />
```

### Applied state

```tsx
<CouponInput appliedCode="SAVE20" onApply={handleApply} onRemove={handleRemove} />
```

Every variant above must have an equivalent demo in `modules/showcase/registry.tsx` with the same title.

## States

| State | KuiReact signal | KuiReact behaviour | KuiNative requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hover | `hover:` classes | hover colour/elevation | pressed state instead (`active:` classes / Pressable `pressed`) |

Plus, for every component: light + dark scheme, font scaling (`allowFontScaling` respected, layout survives 200 % text), and RTL (`I18nManager.isRTL`).

## Accessibility Requirements

KuiReact uses the following; each needs its React Native equivalent:

| KuiReact | React Native |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-hidden` | `accessibilityElementsHidden` + `importantForAccessibility="no-hide-descendants"` |
| `aria-label` | `accessibilityLabel` |

Platform requirements (all components):

- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 pt (iOS) / 48×48 dp (Android) — use `hitSlop` when the visual is smaller.
- Every interactive element has `accessibilityRole` and an accessible name; decorative icons are hidden from the accessibility tree.
- Do not nest multiple interactive elements inside one accessible `Pressable` (iOS merges them into a single element).
- KuiReact handles keyboard input; provide the same on react-native-web and with hardware keyboards (focusable, `onKeyPress`), and a touch/screen-reader alternative (accessibilityActions) on native.

## Design Tokens

| Token | Light | Dark | In KuiNative theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `error` | #ef4444 | #f87171 | ✓ |
| `success` | #22c55e | #4ade80 | ✓ |
| `success-fg` | #14532d | #bbf7d0 | ✓ |
| `success-subtle` | #f0fdf4 | #052e16 | ✓ |

Use NativeWind classes (`bg-error`, …); only props that cannot take `className` (icon `color`, `placeholderTextColor`, `trackColor`, SVG `fill`) may read `useThemeTokens()`. No raw hex.

## Dependencies

**KuiReact components it composes:**

- Button — exists as `Button`
- Input — exists as `TextInput`

**Blocked by (roadmap):** the primitives above reaching parity

**Third-party:** `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` → @fortawesome/react-native-fontawesome, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`

## Implementation Notes

- Location: `modules/domains/common/CouponInput.tsx`, named export `CouponInput` (same name as KuiReact), re-exported from the layer barrel.
- Styling via `cn()` + semantic token classes; variant/size maps as `Record<Variant, string>` like the existing KuiNative components.
- Props: keep KuiReact names/defaults; spread remaining host props (`...rest`) and forward `ref` so `testID`, `accessibilityHint`, `hitSlop` etc. pass through (current KuiNative components mostly do not).
- Export the `CouponInputProps` type.
- Add a showcase entry (`modules/showcase/registry.tsx`) with one demo per KuiReact variant.
- Domain component: create `modules/domains/common/` with a barrel; do not import across verticals (KuiReact enforces this with `check:cross-vertical`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exported as `CouponInput` from the `modules/domains/common` barrel with its props type
- [ ] All 4 KuiReact props present with identical names and defaults, or each deviation recorded in `parity.exceptions.json` (RN mappings above are pre-approved deviations)
- [ ] Showcase demos for all 2 KuiReact variants (Default (try SAVE20), Applied state)
- [ ] State **hover** implemented: pressed state instead (`active:` classes / Pressable `pressed`)
- [ ] Accessibility mappings in the table above implemented and verified with VoiceOver and TalkBack
- [ ] Uses only semantic tokens (`error`, `success`, `success-fg`, `success-subtle`); renders correctly in light and dark
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest + @testing-library/react-native) cover render, every variant/size, every state, callbacks and accessibility props
- [ ] Prop table + usage snippet documented in the showcase entry
