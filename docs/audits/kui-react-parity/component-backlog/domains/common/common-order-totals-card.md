## Overview

Order summary card showing subtotal, discount, tax, service fee, shipping, and an emphasized total. Zero-value lines are hidden automatically.

**Why it matters for KuiNative:** Common vertical is shipped in KuiReact's npm package (`./common` entry) and is shared with KuiEJS; it is the only domain vertical with a parity obligation.

## Required Props

Parsed from `modules/domains/common/money/OrderTotalsCard.tsx`. **Required** = not optional in KuiReact's type. The KuiNative API must keep these names and defaults unless the RN column says otherwise.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Notes | RN mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `totals` | `OrderTotals` | **yes** | — |  | same |
| `locale` | `string` | no | — |  | same |
| `className` | `string` | no | — |  | keep (NativeWind) |

## Variants

### No extras

```tsx
<OrderTotalsCard currency="USD" totals={{ subtotal: 89.99, total: 89.99 }} />
```

### With discount, tax & shipping

```tsx
<OrderTotalsCard currency="USD" totals={{ subtotal: 149.99, discountTotal: 20, taxTotal: 11.99, shippingTotal: 9.99, total: 153.96 }} />
```

Every variant above must have an equivalent demo in `modules/showcase/registry.tsx` with the same title.

## States

_No interactive states detected from props; verify in source._

Plus, for every component: light + dark scheme, font scaling (`allowFontScaling` respected, layout survives 200 % text), and RTL (`I18nManager.isRTL`).

## Accessibility Requirements

KuiReact source uses no explicit ARIA attributes or roles for this component.

Platform requirements (all components):

- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 pt (iOS) / 48×48 dp (Android) — use `hitSlop` when the visual is smaller.
- Every interactive element has `accessibilityRole` and an accessible name; decorative icons are hidden from the accessibility tree.
- Do not nest multiple interactive elements inside one accessible `Pressable` (iOS merges them into a single element).

## Design Tokens

| Token | Light | Dark | In KuiNative theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `border` | #e5e7eb | #334155 | ✓ |
| `success-fg` | #14532d | #bbf7d0 | ✓ |
| `surface-raised` | #f9fafb | #1e293b | ✓ |
| `text-primary` | #111827 | #f1f5f9 | ✓ |
| `text-secondary` | #6b7280 | #94a3b8 | ✓ |

Use NativeWind classes (`bg-border`, …); only props that cannot take `className` (icon `color`, `placeholderTextColor`, `trackColor`, SVG `fill`) may read `useThemeTokens()`. No raw hex.

## Dependencies

**KuiReact components it composes:**

- PriceDisplay — missing → [backlog](common-price-display.md)

**Blocked by (roadmap):** the primitives above reaching parity

**Third-party:** none

## Implementation Notes

- Location: `modules/domains/common/OrderTotalsCard.tsx`, named export `OrderTotalsCard` (same name as KuiReact), re-exported from the layer barrel.
- Styling via `cn()` + semantic token classes; variant/size maps as `Record<Variant, string>` like the existing KuiNative components.
- Props: keep KuiReact names/defaults; spread remaining host props (`...rest`) and forward `ref` so `testID`, `accessibilityHint`, `hitSlop` etc. pass through (current KuiNative components mostly do not).
- Export the `OrderTotalsCardProps` type.
- Add a showcase entry (`modules/showcase/registry.tsx`) with one demo per KuiReact variant.
- Domain component: create `modules/domains/common/` with a barrel; do not import across verticals (KuiReact enforces this with `check:cross-vertical`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exported as `OrderTotalsCard` from the `modules/domains/common` barrel with its props type
- [ ] All 3 KuiReact props present with identical names and defaults, or each deviation recorded in `parity.exceptions.json` (RN mappings above are pre-approved deviations)
- [ ] Showcase demos for all 2 KuiReact variants (No extras, With discount, tax & shipping)
- [ ] Uses only semantic tokens (`border`, `success-fg`, `surface-raised`, `text-primary`, `text-secondary`); renders correctly in light and dark
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest + @testing-library/react-native) cover render, every variant/size, every state, callbacks and accessibility props
- [ ] Prop table + usage snippet documented in the showcase entry
