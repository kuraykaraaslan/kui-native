## Overview

Full credit card entry form with live card visual preview. Auto-detects brand, formats number, flips card on CVV focus, validates expiry.

**Why it matters for KuiNative:** Common vertical is shipped in KuiReact's npm package (`./common` entry) and is shared with KuiEJS; it is the only domain vertical with a parity obligation.

## Required Props

Parsed from `modules/domains/common/payment/CreditCardForm.tsx`. **Required** = not optional in KuiReact's type. The KuiNative API must keep these names and defaults unless the RN column says otherwise.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Notes | RN mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onSubmit` | `(values: CreditCardInput) => Promise<void> \| void` | **yes** | — |  | same |
| `onCancel` | `() => void` | no | — |  | same |
| `error` | `string` | no | — |  | same |
| `className` | `string` | no | — |  | keep (NativeWind) |

## Variants

### Default

```tsx
<CreditCardForm onSubmit={async (card) => saveCard(card)} onCancel={handleCancel} />
```

### Server error

```tsx
<CreditCardForm onSubmit={handleSave} error="Card declined. Please try a different card." />
```

Every variant above must have an equivalent demo in `modules/showcase/registry.tsx` with the same title.

## States

| State | KuiReact signal | KuiReact behaviour | KuiNative requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| error | `error` | error tokens, message with role=alert | error tokens + message announced (live region / announceForAccessibility) |

Plus, for every component: light + dark scheme, font scaling (`allowFontScaling` respected, layout survives 200 % text), and RTL (`I18nManager.isRTL`).

## Accessibility Requirements

KuiReact source uses no explicit ARIA attributes or roles for this component.

Platform requirements (all components):

- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 pt (iOS) / 48×48 dp (Android) — use `hitSlop` when the visual is smaller.
- Every interactive element has `accessibilityRole` and an accessible name; decorative icons are hidden from the accessibility tree.
- Do not nest multiple interactive elements inside one accessible `Pressable` (iOS merges them into a single element).

## Design Tokens

_No semantic color tokens detected._

Use NativeWind classes (`bg-primary`, …); only props that cannot take `className` (icon `color`, `placeholderTextColor`, `trackColor`, SVG `fill`) may read `useThemeTokens()`. No raw hex.

## Dependencies

**KuiReact components it composes:**

- Button — exists as `Button`
- CreditCardVisual — missing → [backlog](common-credit-card-visual.md)
- Form — missing → [backlog](../../form.md)
- Input — exists as `TextInput`

**Blocked by (roadmap):** the primitives above reaching parity

**Third-party:** none

## Implementation Notes

- Location: `modules/domains/common/CreditCardForm.tsx`, named export `CreditCardForm` (same name as KuiReact), re-exported from the layer barrel.
- Styling via `cn()` + semantic token classes; variant/size maps as `Record<Variant, string>` like the existing KuiNative components.
- Props: keep KuiReact names/defaults; spread remaining host props (`...rest`) and forward `ref` so `testID`, `accessibilityHint`, `hitSlop` etc. pass through (current KuiNative components mostly do not).
- Export the `CreditCardFormProps` type.
- Add a showcase entry (`modules/showcase/registry.tsx`) with one demo per KuiReact variant.
- Domain component: create `modules/domains/common/` with a barrel; do not import across verticals (KuiReact enforces this with `check:cross-vertical`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exported as `CreditCardForm` from the `modules/domains/common` barrel with its props type
- [ ] All 4 KuiReact props present with identical names and defaults, or each deviation recorded in `parity.exceptions.json` (RN mappings above are pre-approved deviations)
- [ ] Showcase demos for all 2 KuiReact variants (Default, Server error)
- [ ] State **error** implemented: error tokens + message announced (live region / announceForAccessibility)
- [ ] Uses only semantic tokens; renders correctly in light and dark
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest + @testing-library/react-native) cover render, every variant/size, every state, callbacks and accessibility props
- [ ] Prop table + usage snippet documented in the showcase entry
